# MyProject
This program is created as part of exersize in Haaga-Helia Univercity of Applied Sciences. The main use cases for this program are:

Use credentials for user identification. Several users can use the program. (Idea is to move from SQLite to CLoud in later phases)
Document construction project with date+comment+pictures.
View projects, diary comments and images.

The program uses SQLite database for storing user login/passwors, project information, diary comments and image information. 
This release includes features for creating new user, new projects, diary comments and image capture.

ToDo:
Show captured images in the project diary. At the moment only the path to the captured image is shown.
